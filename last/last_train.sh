# -P4: makes it faster by using 4 threads (This has no effect on the results.)
# -c: Soft-mask lowercase letters.  This means that, when we compare
#     these sequences to some other sequences using lastal, lowercase
#     letters will be excluded from initial matches.  This will apply
#     to lowercase letters in both sets of sequences.
# -uRY4: selects a seeding scheme that reduces the run time and memory use, but also reduces sensitivity.

# --revsym: Force the substitution scores to have reverse-complement
#           symmetry, e.g. score(A→G) = score(T→C).  This is often
#           appropriate, if neither strand is "special".
# -C COUNT: Before extending gapped alignments, discard any gapless alignment whose query range lies in COUNT other gapless alignments with higher score-per-length. This aims to reduce run time. -C2 may reduce run time with little effect on accuracy.
