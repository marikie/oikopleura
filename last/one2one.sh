# -P8: makes it faster by using 8 threads (This has no effect on the results.)
# -c: Soft-mask lowercase letters.  This means that, when we compare
#     these sequences to some other sequences using lastal, lowercase
#     letters will be excluded from initial matches.  This will apply
#     to lowercase letters in both sets of sequences.
# -uRY4: selects a seeding scheme that reduces the run time and memory use, but also reduces sensitivity.

# --revsym: Force the substitution scores to have reverse-complement
#           symmetry, e.g. score(A→G) = score(T→C).  This is often
#           appropriate, if neither strand is "special".
# -C COUNT: Before extending gapped alignments, discard any gapless alignment whose query range lies in COUNT other gapless alignments with higher score-per-length. This aims to reduce run time. -C2 may reduce run time with little effect on accuracy.

#(-j4: show the confidence of each alignment column)
# -H EXPECT: report alignments that are expected by chance at most EXPECT times, in all the sequences. This option requires reading the queries twice (to get their lengths before finding alignments), so it doesn't allow piped-in queries.
# -j4 and --split-f=MAF+: lastal can optionally write "p" lines, indicating the probability that each base is misaligned due to wrong gap placement. last-split, on the other hand, writes "p" lines indicating the probability that each base is aligned to the wrong genomic locus. You can combine both sources of error (roughly) by taking the maximum of the two error probabilities for each base.

# maf-linked: maf-linked reads pair-wise sequence alignments in MAF format, and omits isolated alignments. It keeps groups of alignments that are nearby in both sequences. It may be useful for genome-to-genome alignments: It removes alignments between non-homologous insertions of homologous transposons
