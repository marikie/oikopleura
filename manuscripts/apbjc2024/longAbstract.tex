\section{Introduction}

Few studies examine single-base substitutions across diverse organisms. Even a recent comprehensive study of vertebrates did not thoroughly investigate single-base substitutions~\cite{bergeron2023evolution}.

\section{Methods}
We investigated trinucleotides to observe substitution trends of not only single-base substitutions but also single-base substitutions considering neighboring bases. We obtained reference genomes for three closely related species (\textit{Species A}, \textit{Species B}, and \textit{Species C}) from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets), with \textit{Species A} as the outgroup in the phylogenetic relationship. Pairwise alignments were performed between \textit{Species A} and \textit{Species B}, and between \textit{Species A} and \textit{Species C}. We examined every set of trinucleotides in the alignments to infer substitutions in \textit{Species B} and \textit{Species C} based on the principle of parsimony. The substitution rate was calculated as the percentage of the number of inferred substitutions divided by the number of original trinucleotides. For instance, if a substitution from $\Cir\Tri\Squ$ to $\Cir\dTri\Squ$ was inferred to have occurred in \textit{Species B}, we incremented the count of the substitution $\Cir\Tri\Squ \rightarrow \Cir\dTri\Squ$ for \textit{Species B} and the count of the original trinucleotide $\Cir\Tri\Squ$ for both \textit{Species B} and \textit{Species C}. Additionally, we incremented the count of the original trinucleotide $\Cir\Tri\Squ$ by 1 if the trinucleotide sequence was $\Cir\Tri\Squ$ in all three species.

\section{Preliminary Results}
We often observe high C>T (or G>A) and T>C (or A>G) substitutions, consistent with the concept of ``transition bias.'' Transitions, mutations between purines (A and G) or pyrimidines (C and T), occur more frequently than transversions, which are mutations between purines and pyrimidines, through evolution.

  It is also known that transitions from strong base pairing to weak base pairing (C>T) occur in a wide range of living organisms, and our results also show this. However, it is interesting to note that this is not always the case. \textit{W.~Hederae}, a fungus often isolated from plant-associated low-water-activity environments and exhibiting halotolerance, shows markedly higher T>C than C>T (\autoref{fig:fig1i}).

  Some species show unique trends of substitutions.
  Two algae species, \textit{P.~bovis} and \textit{P.~ciferrii}, show high C>G substitutions (\autoref{fig:fig1l}). They belong to the genus \textit{Prototheca}, which is a unicellular, achlorophyllous, yeast-like algae that can induce protothecosis in humans and animals.
  The animal plankton, \textit{O.~albicans}, shows high T>A and T>G substitutions (\autoref{fig:fig1m}), while \textit{O.~vanhoeffeni} shows high C>A substitutions.

  It is well-documented that CG>TG mutations have a high rate. We observed dominant CG>TG substitutions in deep-sea and shallow-sea mussels (\textit{B.~brooksi}, \textit{B.~septemdierum}, \textit{M.~galloprovincialis}, and \textit{M. edulis}), with 4 out of the top 5 substitution patterns including CG>TG (\autoref{fig:fig1a}). Surprisingly, this trend was not observed in other organisms.

  UV-induced DNA damage is formed between two successive pyrimidine bases (CC, CT, TC, and TT). We hypothesized that these substitutions would be prevalent only in organisms frequently exposed to sunlight, such as surface-dwelling animal plankton. However, we observed these substitutions across all organisms investigated, including deep-sea mussels that live at depths of 1000-3000 meters in complete darkness.
