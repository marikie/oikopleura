Understanding substitution trends through evolution is crucial, yet research on single-base substitutions across different organisms remains sparse. To address this gap, we investigated trinucleotides to observe substitution trends, including neighbor-dependent ones. We inferred substitution directions by comparing three closely related species from various taxa using the principle of parsimony. Our results show consistency with "transition bias" and confirm that transitions from strong to weak base pairing (C>T) are common across organisms. However, unique trends were noted: the fungus W. hederae shows higher T>C than C>T substitutions. The algae P. bovis and P. ciferrii exhibit high C>G substitutions, while the plankton O. albicans shows high T>A and T>G substitutions, and O. vanhoeffeni has high C>A substitutions. Dominant CpG dinucleotide substitutions were observed in deep-sea and shallow-sea mussels (B. brooksi, B. septemdierum, M. galloprovincialis, and M. edulis), a trend not seen in other organisms. Surprisingly, substitutions between dipyrimidines, typical of UV-induced DNA damage, were observed in all organisms, including deep-sea mussels, contrary to our hypothesis that they would be prevalent only in sunlight-exposed organisms like surface-dwelling plankton. These findings provide valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of single-base substitutions across diverse taxa.
